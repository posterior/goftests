    This function computes the incomplete lower gamma function

       \gamma(x, s) = x^s \Gamma(s)e^{-x}\sum^\infty_{k=0}
                    \frac{x^k}{\Gamma(s + k + 1)}

    This series will converge strongly because the Gamma
    function grows factorially.

    Because the Gamma function does grow so quickly, we can
    run into numerical stability issues. To solve this we carry
    out as much math as possible in the log domain to reduce
    numerical error. This function matches the results from
    scipy to numerical precision.
